c4l-docker-article
==================
An article for [code4lib journal](http://journal.code4lib.org/) about virtualization in general and [Docker](http://docker.io) in particular. I am doing the writing in [StackEdit](https://stackedit.io) so the commit messages for the article text will not be that descriptive. Most of the action will probably be in the [from-stackedit](https://github.com/jbfink/c4l-docker-article/tree/from-stackedit) branch until things firm up a little more. Also, an outline for this article appears as a [gist](https://gist.github.com/jbfink/8789677) so you can take a look at that as well.
